# uc dns

Manage cluster domain in Uncloud DNS.

## Synopsis

Manage cluster domain in Uncloud DNS.
DNS commands allow you to reserve or release a unique '\<id>.cluster.uncloud.run' domain for your cluster. When reserved, Caddy service deployments will automatically update DNS records to route traffic to the services in the cluster.

## Options

```
  -h, --help   help for dns
```

## Options inherited from parent commands
