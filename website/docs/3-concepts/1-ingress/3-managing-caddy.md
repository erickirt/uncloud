# Managing Caddy

Caddy is automatically deployed as a global service `caddy` when you initialise a cluster with `uc machine init`. By
default, it runs on every machine to handle incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic and route it to your services.

## Checking status

View the `caddy` service status and which machines it's running on:

```shell
uc inspect caddy
```

```
ID:    b5b269d5dc5ed4fdae6542894f94de82
Name:  caddy
Mode:  global

CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          CREATED        STATUS       MACHINE
fb8f390e634d   caddy:2.10.0   3 weeks ago    Up 3 weeks   prod-ap1
0182f5d7bd9f   caddy:2.10.0   3 months ago   Up 3 weeks   prod-us1
```

## Deploying or updating Caddy

### Using CLI

Update to the latest stable version using the [caddy](https://hub.docker.com/_/caddy) image from Docker Hub:

```shell
uc caddy deploy
```

Deploy a specific version or custom image:

```shell
uc caddy deploy --image caddybuilds/caddy-cloudflare:2.10.2
```

Deploy only to a specific machine or a subset of machines (comma-separated list):

```shell
uc caddy deploy --machine machine1
uc caddy deploy --machine machine2,machine3,machine4
```

Deploy with custom global configuration:

```shell
uc caddy deploy --caddyfile global.Caddyfile
```

Example global configuration:

```caddyfile title=global.Caddyfile
# Global options.
{
    debug
}

# A snippet that can be reused in custom Caddy configs for services (x-caddy).
(my_snippet) {
    ...
}

# Expose an internal service that is not managed by Uncloud.
internal.example.com {
    reverse_proxy 192.168.1.100
}
```

### Using Compose

You can manage the Caddy deployment with a Compose file for more control. For example, to deploy a custom global Caddy
config that uses the DNS challenge with Cloudflare to obtain a wildcard TLS certificate for `*.example.com`:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="compose.yaml">

```yaml
services:
  caddy:
    image: caddybuilds/caddy-cloudflare:2.10.2
    command: caddy run -c /config/Caddyfile
    environment:
      CADDY_ADMIN: unix//run/caddy/admin.sock
    env_file:
      # Contains CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=xxxxx
      - .env.secrets
    volumes:
      - /var/lib/uncloud/caddy:/data
      - /var/lib/uncloud/caddy:/config
      - /run/uncloud/caddy:/run/caddy
    x-ports:
      - 80:80@host
      - 443:443@host
    x-caddy: Caddyfile
    deploy:
      mode: global
    # Optional: deploy only to specific machines.
    # x-machines:
    #   - machine1
    #   - machine2
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Caddyfile">

```caddyfile
# Global options.
{
	debug
}

# A snippet that can be reused in custom Caddy configs for services (x-caddy).
(my_snippet) {
	...
}

# Obtain a wildcard TLS certificate for all subdomains of example.name using DNS challenge with Cloudflare.
# It will be used for services that publish ports with hostnames under example.name.
*.example.com {
	tls {
		dns cloudflare {env.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}
	}
	respond "No host matched" 404
}

# Expose an internal service that is not managed by Uncloud.
internal.example.com {
	reverse_proxy 192.168.1.100
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::info note

The specified `command`, `environment`, `volumes`, and `x-ports` properties are essential for Caddy to function
correctly in the Uncloud cluster.

:::

Deploy or update the `caddy` service from the Compose file:

```shell
uc deploy
```

## Verifying config

View the complete generated Caddyfile served by the `caddy` service. This is useful for debugging and verifying custom
global and service-specific Caddy configs.

```shell
uc caddy config
```

Example output:

```caddyfile
# This file is autogenerated by Uncloud based on the configuration of running services.
# Do not edit manually. Any manual changes will be overwritten on the next update.

# User-defined global config from service 'caddy'.
# Global options.
{
	debug
}

# A snippet that can be reused in custom Caddy configs for services (x-caddy).
(my_snippet) {
	...
}

# Obtain a wildcard TLS certificate for all subdomains of example.name using DNS challenge with Cloudflare.
# It will be used for services that publish ports with hostnames under example.name.
*.example.com {
	tls {
		dns cloudflare {env.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}
	}
	respond "No host matched" 404
}

# Expose an internal service that is not managed by Uncloud.
internal.example.com {
	reverse_proxy 192.168.1.100
}

# Health check endpoint to verify Caddy reachability on this machine.
http:// {
	handle /.uncloud-verify {
		respond "a369b9388812f9557feef6a0f5b46f2e" 200
	}
	log
}

(common_proxy) {
	# Retry failed requests up to lb_retries times against other available upstreams.
	lb_retries 3
	# Upstreams are marked unhealthy for fail_duration after a failed request (passive health checking).
	fail_duration 30s
}

# Sites generated from service ports.

https://app.example.com {
	reverse_proxy 10.210.1.3:8000 10.210.2.5:8000 {
		import common_proxy
	}
	log
}

https://api.example.com {
	reverse_proxy 10.210.2.2:9000 10.210.1.7:9000 10.210.2.3:9000 {
		import common_proxy
	}
	log
}

# User-defined config for service 'web'.
www.example.com {
	redir https://example.com{uri} permanent
}

example.com {
	reverse_proxy 10.210.0.3:8000 {
		import common_proxy
	}
	log
}

# Skipped invalid user-defined configs:
# - service 'duplicate-hostname': validation failed: adapting config using caddyfile adapter: ambiguous site definition: example.com
# - service 'invalid': validation failed: adapting config using caddyfile adapter: Caddyfile:61: unrecognized directive: invalid_directive
```

The generated config combines:

- Global Caddy configuration (`x-caddy` from the `caddy` service).
- Auto-generated configs from published service ports (`x-ports`).
- Custom Caddy configs from services (`x-caddy`).
- Skipped invalid configs with error messages as comments.
